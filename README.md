# 📚 AI-Powered Adaptive Learning System for Neurodiverse Students - Team WASD
**Empowering Learning Through Personalization and Inclusivity**  


---

## 🌟 **Overview**  
This AI-powered adaptive learning system is designed to enhance the educational experience for neurodiverse students, including those with ADHD, dyslexia, and varied learning speeds. By leveraging AI, machine learning, and multimodal assessment tools, the system provides tailored learning pathways that adapt to individual needs.

## 🧠 **Key Features**  

### Phase 1: **Initial Screening Test**  
- **Objective:** Identify learning patterns and neurodiversity markers through engaging, non-intimidating tasks.  
- **Methods:**  
  - Psychometric tests (based on DSM-5 for ADHD, standardized dyslexia assessments).  
  - AI-powered speech and text analysis for reading fluency and comprehension.  
  - Adaptive game-based tasks to assess attention, processing speed, and cognitive responses.  

### Phase 2: **Confirmation Test (Diagnosis Validation)**  
- **Objective:** Provide deeper diagnostic assessments based on Phase 1 findings.  
- **Methods:**  
  - AI-driven insights on attention loss, reading errors, and cognitive load.  
  - Reaction time, impulse control, and time-tracking analysis to validate results.  
  - Speech/voice analysis (optional) to detect stress, hesitation, and focus levels.  

### Phase 3: **Personalized Learning Assistance**  
- **Objective:** Deliver custom learning plans and continuous support based on assessment results.  
- **Features:**  
  - **Restructured Study Material:** Text simplification, color-coded notes (for dyslexia).  
  - **Focus & Time Management Tools:** Daily focus challenges and adaptive learning paths.  
  - **AI Chatbot:** Voice/text-based support for real-time guidance.  
  - **Gamified Learning Modules:** Engaging content to maintain motivation and track progress.

## 🎯 **Problem Statement**  
Learning difficulties among neurodiverse students often go unnoticed or unaddressed due to the lack of personalized teaching approaches. This project aims to create an inclusive learning system that dynamically adapts to individual cognitive needs, offering tailored study material, interactive learning modules, and AI-driven diagnostic insights.  

---

## 🔍 **Why This Solution Matters**  
- **Inclusivity:** Designed to address the specific needs of neurodiverse learners.  
- **Engagement:** Gamified, adaptive learning keeps students motivated.  
- **AI Insights:** Personalized learning plans evolve based on real-time assessments.  

---

## 🛠️ **Tech Stack**  
- **Programming Languages:** Python, JavaScript  
- **AI Tools:** Machine Learning (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow)  
- **Web Technologies:** React, Node.js  
- **APIs:** STT (Speech-to-Text), TTS (Text-to-Speech), NLP for sentiment and stress analysis
